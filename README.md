# MAC-unit

Multiply and accumulations(MAC) are fundamental operations for domain-specific accelerator with AI applications ranging from filtering to convolutional neural networks(CNN).
MAC unit is a fundamental block in the computing devices, especially Digital Signal Processor (DSP). MAC unit performs multiplication and accumulation process. Basic MAC unit consists of multiplier, adder, and accumulator.
